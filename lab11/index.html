        <h1 class="dodgerblue">Hanaah Junaideen's Biography</h1>
        <main>
        <p> Hanaah was born in Greenwich, Connecticut as a <strong>triplet</strong>. She lived in Connecticut with my family until she was 9, and then they moved to Potomac, Maryland, which is where she still live today. </p>
        <p>
            When the college application process was starting during her junior year of high school, Hanaah never expected to want to go to Syracuse. Because she went to a really small Episcopalian high school, she thought she wanted to go to a college with a similar style. This all changed, however, when she did a virtual campus tour of Syracuse. Hanaah immediately fell in love with the school, applied Early Decision, and have been loving her time here ever since. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hanaah Junaideen is a junior majoring in Policy Studies and minoring in Information Technology Management. She is interested in researching statistics related to crime and healthcare. She have a strong skillset in all of Microsoft suite, specifically Excel.
