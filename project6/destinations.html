          <p class="kenyatext">The Maasai Mara in Kenya is a place where the wild African savannah comes to life. I had the privilege of embarking on a thrilling weeklong safari here, where I was able to witness the Big Five (African elephant, lion, leopard, cape buffalo, and rhinoceros) as well as the Great Migration. There was also truly nothing like the experience of a hot air balloon ride over the vast plains, watching the sunrise and the animals below. My family loves to try different types of food, and we absolutely loved Nyama Choma (grilled meat), prepared for us at a local Maasai village. I cannot recommend the Mara Plains Camp enough - we were treated so well by the staff, who positively contributed to our “glamping” experience!</p>

                I lived in Singapore for 2 years and have gone back to visit 4 additional times – all testaments to why it is one of absolute favorite countries. Singapore is a city that seamlessly blends modernity with tradition – Gardens by the Bay is a futuristic wonder, with its towering Supertrees and the otherworldly Cloud Forest. Marina Bay Sands SkyPark offers panoramic views of the city skyline. I lived on Nassim Road, which was a very short drive to Marina Bay Sands, so I am biased when I say I love this area. Shopping enthusiasts will find their paradise on Orchard Road, with its array of high-end boutiques. You could find me here in my free time! When it comes to food, Hainanese Chicken Rice is a Singaporean classic, while Chili Crab is a flavorful indulgence. Because I am from Maryland, I have a natural love for crabs, so the chili crab is one of my favorite dishes. Whenever my family goes back to visit, we stay at the Marina Bay Sands – an absolutely iconic resort with an infinity pool that seems to touch the sky.

          <p class="kenyatext">Cambodia is a land of ancient wonders, and at the heart of it lies the majestic Angkor Wat. Exploring the intricate temples, especially during sunrise or sunset, is an experience that will stay with you forever. Another highlight from my trip is a cruise on Tonle Sap Lake, where you can witness the vibrant floating villages – this was so picturesque! The cuisine here is a delightful fusion of flavors, and you must indulge in dishes like Amok and Lok Lak. My family actually took a cooking class in one of the villages – it was so fun to work in the kitchen with local Cambodians and learn about their culture while preparing delicious plates of food. We stayed at the Belmond La Résidence d’Angkor and was given a truly indulgent experience. Once again, the staff was so accommodating and positive, which really made our time spent in Cambodia so delightful. </p>

                My trip to Japan was one of my favorite trips I’ve ever been on. This special country is a land where tradition and modernity blend seamlessly. One of my favorite experiences here was witnessing cherry blossoms in full bloom, especially in Kyoto's stunning gardens. I am from the Washington, D.C. area, so I am no stranger to seeing cherry blossoms, but seeing them in Japan was something out of a movie! Exploring Kyoto's temples is also a must, with Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion) being a highlight. My parents really enjoyed this one! Of course, no trip to Japan is complete without indulging in sushi in Tokyo. Whether you prefer traditional sushi bars or high-end establishments, the options are endless. Ramen and Tempura are also must-try dishes. We stayed at the Aman Tokyo, which offers a serene retreat in the heart of the bustling city. It was a satisfying change of pace from the busy city to the calm grounds of the hotel.

The overwater bungalow experience here is unlike any other, where you can wake up to crystal-clear waters right beneath your feet. I woke up each morning and immediately went swimming in the ocean that was literally in our backyard. Snorkeling and scuba diving here was exceptional, with vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life. Maldivian Fish Curry and Tuna Salad are some of the local delicacies you should savor – my parents were big fans of these fishes. We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, which offered us unparalleled luxury and privacy. With a private overwater bungalow, we were able to snorkel and relax as we pleased. Ultimately, this vacation was the epitome of relaxation, and I am thankful I was able to go. </p>

                Oman is a land of rich culture and natural beauty. Exploring Muscat's traditional souks and vibrant markets was a treat for my senses! You can also embark on a Wahiba Sands desert safari to witness the stunning dunes and experience Bedouin hospitality. The food in Oman is a reflection of its heritage, with dishes like Shuwa (slow-cooked lamb) and Harees (a porridge-like dish) being local favorites. Personally, I loved Shuwa with naan. The Bimmah Sinkhole was also unbelievable – my brother actually dropped his phone into the water and broke it by accident, but besides that, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. We stayed at the Six Senses Zighy Bay Resort, which offered a secluded escape with private villas and breathtaking views of the Musandam Peninsula.              </p>

Thailand offers a diverse range of experiences, from exploring the ornate temples of Bangkok to the idyllic beaches of the Phi Phi Islands. We did a sunset catamaran tour around the Phi Phi islands, and snorkeling in that beautiful water is something I miss. I also went scuba diving for the first time here, which was definietely an experience, to say the least. For a deep dive into Thai culture, consider taking a traditional Thai cooking class, where you can learn to prepare dishes like Pad Thai, Tom Yum Goong, and Green Curry.  </p>

                I am a triplet, and every year on my siblings and my birthday, my parents love to celebrate in a big way. For our 13th birthday we went to Turkey, so this trip is still very special to me. Turkey is a land of rich history and stunning landscapes. Istanbul is a city where East meets West, and exploring its historic sites, such as the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, is a must. We also went hot air ballooning in Cappadocia, and even though I am very afraid of heights, it was an incredible experience that I would gladly do again. Turkish food is one of my favorite cuisines, so eating here was delightful! Dishes like Kebabs, Baklava, and Turkish Delight truly satisfied every craving I had during my stay. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Istanbul, which was located right in the heart of the city. The location was extremely convenient and we were offered amazing service as well.                </p>

Dubai is the hub of luxury and modernity - the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest skyscraper, is a symbol of architectural marvel. We love to see the water and light shows that happen weekly at the foot of the Burj! A desert safari is a thrilling way to experience the UAE's unique landscape, complete with dune bashing – this was really fun, and I couldn’t recommend it enough. When it comes to food, Shawarma, Al Harees (a slow-cooked dish), and Arabic Coffee are must-try dishes. When we go to Dubai, we normally stay with our family, which like Malaysia, offers us the local experience. It is always fun to drop my cousins off at school and browse the malls! If we decide to stay at a hotel, we normally go to the Burj Al Arab, which is a sail-shaped hotel which really intrigues me.</p>

                Vietnam is a country that offers a rich tapestry of experiences, from cruising in Halong Bay to exploring bustling markets in Hanoi. We were on a cruise for a few days down Halong Bay, which was so unique! The boat was small, but we were able to meet many other tourists with interesting backgrounds. We also made our own spring rolls from scratch! Hanoi's Old Quarter is a maze of narrow streets filled with street food stalls and shops. Savoring a bowl of Pho (noodle soup) from a local vendor is an authentic experience. Bun Cha (grilled pork with noodles) and fresh spring rolls are also must-try dishes. When we weren’t on the boat, we stayed at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi - a historic gem in the heart of the city.         </div>

Whether you're exploring the Louvre Museum or strolling along the Seine River, you'll be enchanted. Bordeaux, known for its world-class wines, offers unforgettable vineyard tours and tastings. We did a winery tour and although I could not drink any of the alcohol at the time, the views itself were stunning. French cuisine is a culinary journey, with Croissants, Escargot (snails), and Coq au Vin (chicken in wine) being classics. I tried escargot for the first time while in Paris, and I did not like it as much as my family members. We stayed at Le Meurice, which was certainly a palace of refinement. </div>

The Casino de Monte-Carlo is a must-visit, whether you're trying your luck at the tables or simply admiring the architecture. I am not much of a gambler, but the design of the building is glamorous and exciting. Exploring the Prince's Palace and its historic rooms offers a glimpse into Monaco's royal heritage. Monte-Carlo is also a shopping paradise, with designer boutiques and high-end jewelers. I really appreciated this part of the trip, as I really love shopping. As for food, don't miss out on trying Barbagiuan (savory pastry), Socca (chickpea pancake), and Stuffed Courgette Flowers. I really loved Socca, and want to find a good restaurant for it in America. We stayed at Hotel de Paris Monte-Carlo, which exudes a very niche type of elegance</p>

Brazilian cuisine is diverse, with Feijoada (a hearty bean stew), Acarajé (deep-fried balls), and Açaí bowls being must-try dishes. During our trip to Rio, we really lucked out on avoiding the crowds of people. My favorite part of this trip was going on a boat that went inside Iguazu falls, a giant waterfull that borders Brazil and Argentina. This was a very unique experience that cannot be replicated anywhere else. We stayed at the Belmond Copacabana Palace right in Rio de Janiero, which offered classic elegance and views of Copacabana Beach, which we visited multiple times during our stay. </p>

                Ecuador is a country of diverse landscapes, from the Galápagos Islands to the Andes Mountains. We visited Quito, the capitol, as well as the Galapagos Islands. Both were extremely interesting and I had a really good time! Exploring the unique ecosystems of the Galápagos is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, with opportunities to encounter giant tortoises, marine iguanas, and blue-footed boobies. In Quito, the capital, you can explore the historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The high elevation briefly took a negative toll on my body, but all was right when I took some medicine. Ceviche, Llapingachos (potato pancakes), and Encebollado (fish soup) are some of the dishes to savor. We stayed at the Finch Bay Galapagos Hotel on the Santa Cruz Island, where sea lions frequently visited and laid around. In Ecuador, we stayed at the Mashpi Lodge - a secluded retreat nestled in the cloud forest. </p>

            <p class="kenyatext">I visited Cancun twice – once with my family, and another with my college housemates during spring break. The complete opposite itineraries of the two trips have made my experience in Cancun extremely well-rounded! When I visited on family vacation, we stayed at the JW Marriott – a resort with everything you could need in the grounds. We spent each day on this trip parasailing, waterskiing, relaxing by the pool, or swimming in the ocean. When I went with my friends, however, we immersed ourselves in the culture a little bit more by going into the city of Cancun and experiencing the local/night life! We stayed at a timeshare family resort, so coming back from a busy day to a peaceful hotel was nice. During my trip with my friends, we were able to see Sean Kingston perform! This was a very fun trip and because we are college students, did not spent too much money. Budgeting was really important during this trip, and we were able to do so successfully. </p>

                Saint Barthelemy, often known as St. Barts, is a Caribbean gem known for its luxurious charm. I recently visited for the first time on family vacation this past summer. Because it was off-season, we were able to enjoy the beaches and walk on the streets without being caught up in any sort of crowd. Pristine beaches like St. Jean and Flamands are perfect for relaxation and snorkeling – we were able to see a variety of beautiful sea life! In Gustavia, the capital, you can explore designer boutiques and enjoy the local Creole cuisine. I personally love Creole food, so this was a fan favorite from me. We stayed at Le Barthélemy Hotel & Spa a beachfront oasis that offers serenity and elegance. Like the Maldives, this trip was extremely relaxing, which was nice after a busy summer! </p>

We stayed in a beautiful AirBNB right by the famous Maho Beach, located right at the end of the airport runway. This was an extremely unique experience – from this location, you watch planes land and take off just overhead. Philipsburg, the capital, offers a delightful mix of colorful buildings and shops. Don't forget to try Johnny Cakes, a local favorite, and sip on Guavaberry Coladas.</p>

                My trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands was a true escape to paradise. Nestled in a luxurious beachfront resort, I woke up to the sound of gentle waves and the sight of crystal-clear turquoise waters just steps from my room. Days were spent lounging on pristine, white sandy beaches and snorkeling among vibrant coral reefs, witnessing a vibrant underwater world. The evenings were equally enchanting, with fine dining at oceanfront restaurants and savoring the freshest seafood. The Turks and Caicos' natural beauty, combined with the high-end resort experience, created a sense of tranquility and indulgence that I will forever cherish. </p>

I stayed at an exquisite beachfront resort that epitomized luxury, where I awoke to the gentle rustling of palm trees and the breathtaking view of the Caribbean Sea. Days were filled with exploring pristine, sun-kissed beaches, indulging in water sports, and discovering the vibrant marine life while snorkeling in crystal-clear waters. In the evenings, I dined on delicious island cuisine under the starry night sky. The US Virgin Islands offered a perfect blend of natural beauty and high-end accommodations, making it a trip I'll always remember as the epitome of relaxation and luxury.</p>

                Fiji is a South Pacific paradise with pristine beaches, vibrant coral reefs, and a warm, welcoming culture. I felt very at peace when I was here – the people are so nice! Relaxing on the beach and snorkeling in crystal-clear waters are among the top activities here. You can also explore local villages and experience Fijian hospitality. Don't miss out on trying Kokoda (marinated fish dish), Lovo (earth oven-cooked meal), and Cassava Cake for dessert. We stayed at the Likuliku Lagoon Resort on Malolo Island, which offered overwater bungalows and serene surroundings. </p>
