    <body>
        My name is Hanaah Junaideen, and I am a junior majoring in Policy Studies and minoring in Information Technology Management, and I am interested in researching statistics related to crime and healthcare. I have a strong skillset in all of Microsoft suite, specifically Excel. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, being outdoors/exercising, and trying different types of food. I donâ€™t watch movies that often because I do not have a good attention span, but my favorite TV show is New Girl.
